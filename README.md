# Code Quiz

## My Goal

Create a basic Javascript quiz that tests the user on basic knowledge of javascript usage.


## Planned functionality of web page

```
The web page once opened should display the beginning of a 5 question quiz.
The user has the ability to click any of the given answers for each question.
The user should have the ability to press buttons to move between questions and submit their quiz.
Once the quiz has been submitted they will be shown the score they earned.
The submission button should also highlight all questions either green or red if the user was right or wrong respectively.

```


## Mock-Up
